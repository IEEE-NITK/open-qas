## Instructions
1. Every submission must have two components:
    1.  The `ipynb` notebook for that week's assignment submission.
    2.  Every week of coursework completed must have an accompanying wiki page (per person). The wiki page is essentially an all-in-one blog post. An example wiki page is present [here](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK/open-qas/wiki/Guru-%7C-Machine-Learning-%7C-Week-1). It should contain:  
        - Notes, for what you learnt
        - References, what website/blog/article (if any), apart from what's given to you in the course, to learn/complete the assignment. 
2. Your submission must be present under `course_name/week-x/your_name/assignment_name.ipynb`.  
The wiki article should have the name `Your Name | Course Name | Week #`. Mintain uniformity while giving these names. Check out the sample wiki page [here](https://github.com/IEEE-NITK/open-qas/wiki/Guru-%7C-Machine-Learning-%7C-Week-1).
3. Every submission should be a pull request to the main repository. Assign @gurupunskill and @anumehaagrawal to review the request.
